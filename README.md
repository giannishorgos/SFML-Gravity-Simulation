# SFML-Gravity-Simulation

I make this project to exercise with C++ and SFML. I wanted to make a game and to apply basics physics so I did a game with a bunch
of balls. On every ball is applied gravity force and the speed of the ball is calculate correctly if the game is working at 60fps.
There is also momentum conservation when the balls hit other ball or walls and friction with the ground and with the air.
