# SFML-Gravity-Simulation

I make this project to exercise with C++ and SFML. I want to make a game and to apply basics fysics so  I did a game with a bunch
of balls. On every ball is applied gravity force and the speed of the ball is calculate correctly if the game is work at 60fps.
There is also momentum conservation when the balls hit other ball or the walls and friction with the ground and with the air.
